What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

     With git init, I initialize a new repository.  I need to do this in order to have a repository for git to use.  It makes a new directory, ".git", that git can now use as the repository for git functionality.  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

     The staging area is a list of things in the working directory that are to be used in a commit soon.  The working directory is still the working area, and the staging area is the "photo frame" for the "snapshot", that is, a commit.  Once the commit is made, that commit/"snapshot" is sent to the repository for archiving.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
